Description: Parametric and nonparametric statistics for single-case design. Regarding nonparametric statistics, the index suggested by Parker, Vannest, Davis and Sauber (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.beth.2010.08.006> was included. It combines both nonoverlap and trend to estimate the effect size of a treatment in a single case design.
